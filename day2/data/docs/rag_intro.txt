RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) combines retrieval with generation.
It first searches a knowledge base for relevant chunks, then feeds them into a language model.
This helps improve factual accuracy and grounding.

Typical pipeline:
1) Split documents into chunks.
2) Convert chunks to vectors (embeddings).
3) Build a vector index.
4) Retrieve top-k chunks for a query.
5) Generate an answer using the retrieved context.
